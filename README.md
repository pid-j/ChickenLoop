# ChickenLoop

ChickenLoop is a Scratch project that contains a cuckooing chicken [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rooster_crowing_small.ogv).

## Licensing

ChickenLoop (the program, at least) is under the GPLv3 license.
[The video in which ChickenLoop is based off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rooster_crowing_small.ogv) of is released in the public domain.

## Download

There are two download options:
+ You can directly download the `.sb3` file from the releases.
+ Alternatively, you can compile ChickenLoop.

### Direct Download

To directly download ChickenLoop, navigate to the releases and download the file labeled as `ChickenLoop.sb3`.

### Compiling ChickenLoop

You can compile ChickenLoop in two ways: **manually** or **automatically**.

#### Manual Compilation

To compile ChickenLoop manually, clone the `src` branch, zip all the files in the directory, and change the `.zip` to `.sb3`.
**MAKE SURE** that the top level directory is the one with all of the resources.

#### Automatic Compilation (Packaging)

To compile ChickenLoop automatically, clone the `src` branch, and download the `Packager.py` file
Drop this file into the folder where the assets are located (where you cloned the `src` branch).
Execute the file, and let it do its packaging (it shouldn't take long).

You can also use the `Packager.py` file to compress other decompressed `.sb3` files.

## Usage

ChickenLoop cannot be imported into the Scratch website, as it is too large.
However, ChickenLoop can be imported into the Scratch/Turbowarp offline app.

You can also use the [ChickenLoop loader](https://turbowarp.org/fullscreen?hqpen&project_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pid-j/ChickenLoop/refs/heads/main/ChickenLoop-loader.sb3)
to load ChickenLoop through a WiFi connection. You can use ChickenLoop on the web this way.
Once it has finished loading, you can download it. For sharing, share the loader **BEFORE**
ChickenLoop was loaded, or redownload the loader.

ChickenLoop can later be packaged with the Turbowarp Packager to one's platform of choice.
