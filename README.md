## Download

There are two download options:
+ You can directly download the `.sb3` file from the releases.
+ Alternatively, you can compile ChickenLoop.

### Direct Download

To directly download ChickenLoop, navigate to the releases and download the file labeled as `ChickenLoop.sb3`.

### Compiling ChickenLoop

You can compile ChickenLoop in two ways: **manually** or **automatically**.

#### Manual Compilation

To compile ChickenLoop manually, clone the `src` branch, zip all the files in the directory, and change the `.zip` to `.sb3`.
**MAKE SURE** that the top level directory is the one with all of the resources.

#### Automatic Compilation

To compile ChickenLoop automatically, clone the `src` branch, and download the `Compiler.py` file. Drop this file into the folder
where the assets are located. Execute the file, and let it do its thing. You can also use `Compiler.sh` instead if you want.

## Usage

ChickenLoop cannot be imported into the Scratch website, as it is too large.
However, ChickenLoop can be imported into the Scratch/Turbowarp offline app.

ChickenLoop can later be packaged with the Turbowarp Packager.
